## Issues I came across
The issues I came was acros was first trying to figure out what name to name my file. I had to google how to clone the repository onto my computer, also forgot that I
to create a repository for it. I actually did most all of the work until I figured out that i had to be saving and pushing my work as I was going along. Another issue I
came across was putting the section labels on CSS and HTML file. 

Over all I belive I have a better understanding of how to create websites.
